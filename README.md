# Biometric_EVM
Designed an EVM system to display vote counts and the result. It was developed using Arduino C. It includes Arduino Nano, 16x2 LCD for user display and Push buttons to register the inputs. Voter has to provide his/her fingerprint 3 times and the sensor calibrates and maintains the database. Arduino's SoftwareSerial library was used for this purpose. At the time of voting, the user has to first verify his/her fingerprint. If fingerprint is verified then only he/she is allowed to vote. User's vote is registered and the vote count is incremented. A hidden button is provided to the authority so that the authorized person can check the vote counts and the result.
